## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See the social media share links when they click the share icon

### Links

- Live Site URL: https://pearlanyanwu.github.io/article-preview.github.io/

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Flexbox
- Javascript

### What I learned

I learned how to build a mobile-first design, then covert it to fit desktops.

### Continued development

I've completed the designs for the most part. The placement of the popup in the mobile view does not match the original design exactly, but it still functions as intended. In the near future, I will improve this.

### Useful resources

- [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_popup.asp) - This helped me create the popup and implement its functionality.
