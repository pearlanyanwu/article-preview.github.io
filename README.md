## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- Javascript

### What I learned

<!-- In this project, I learned how to implement hide/show functionality on a popup element using JS DOM manipulation.

```css
span {
  visibility: hidden;
}
.showApps {
  visibility: visible;
}
```
```js
const shareButton = document.getElementById("share-button");
const popup = document.getElementById("popup");

shareButton.addEventListener("click", () => {
  popup.classList.toggle("showApps");
});
``` -->

### Continued Development

- Still working on responsiveness on smaller screen sizes.

### Useful resources

<!-- - [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_popup.asp) - This helped me create the popup and its functionality. -->
